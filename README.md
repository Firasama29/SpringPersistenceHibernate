In this project I created 4 micro services which are interconnected with each other by rest call.
Haven't secured my services.
These services I want to secure in future.
These 4 services are 
1. common
2. report
3. notification
4. document

common microservice for general purpose like registration etc and store data in mysql database.
report to generate report using iReport.
notification to send notification and creating report using report service.
document for uploading and downloading documents in mongo db.

TODO: Have to secure it using token authentication process OAUTH 2.
Thanks
